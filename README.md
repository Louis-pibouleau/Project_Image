1. Project Overview and Results
This project implements a real-time face detection system using the Viola-Jones algorithm. The system leverages Haar-like features and a cascade of classifiers to detect faces in video streams captured by a webcam.

Objective: Provide a lightweight, real-time facial detection solution without deep learning.
Key Results:
Accuracy: Robust detection of faces under normal lighting conditions.
Speed: Real-time performance on standard laptops.
Application: Usable for basic surveillance, presence detection, and access systems.
The Viola-Jones algorithm ensures a fast and efficient approach suitable for resource-constrained systems.

2. Source Code
The project structure is as follows:
/face detection viola-jones
├── README.md             # Project description and instructions
├── face_detec.py         # Main script for face detection
└── requirements.txt      # List of dependencies

main.py: Contains the implementation of face detection.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required to run the code.

3. Performance Metrics
Detection Time: ~30 frames per second on a standard laptop with OpenCV.
Memory Usage: Minimal, as it uses pre-trained Haar cascades.
Limitations: Performance may degrade under poor lighting or for occluded faces.
Visualization: The detected faces are marked with bounding boxes on a live video stream.
